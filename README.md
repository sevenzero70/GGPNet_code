# GGPNet_code
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper:  
**"Unlocking spatial textures: Gradient-guided pansharpening for enhancing multispectral imagery"**.
The code is being organized! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Environment
The code is developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.8.5. The following packages are required:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Datasets
The code is tested on the following datasets:
- [PanCollection](https://github.com/liangjiandeng/PanCollection)

## Training
To train the model, run the following command:
> python train_PReNet.py

## Testing
To test the model, run the following command:
> python test_s_sota.py --model_name PReNetGradient

## Pretrained models
We will provide the following pretrained models
